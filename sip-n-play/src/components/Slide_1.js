                Founder, Jonathan Li, shares a passion for board games, boba, 
                and delicious food, so he combined them all to become Sip & 
                Play, Park Slope&apos;â€™s first board game cafe.
                It is a straightforward concept, come in with your friends 
                and family to play any board game from our library of 300+ 
                games! We hope when you visit, you also enjoy our coffee, 
                espresso, boba, sandwiches, and snacks!
