                    Founder, Jonathan Li, shares a passion for board games, boba,
                    and delicious food, so he combined them all to become Sip &
                    Play, Park Slope&aposâ€™s first board game cafe.
                    It is a straightforward concept, come in with your friends
                    and family to play any board game from our library of 300+
                    games! We hope when you visit, you also enjoy our coffee,
                    espresso, boba, sandwiches, and snacks!
